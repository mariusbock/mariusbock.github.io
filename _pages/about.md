I am currently doing a PhD as part of the Computer Vision group headed by [Prof. Dr. Michael Moeller](https://sites.google.com/site/michaelmoellermath) and the Ubiquitous Computing group headed by [Prof. Dr. Kristof Van Laerhoven](https://ubicomp.eti.uni-siegen.de/home/team/kristof.html?lang=de) at the University of Siegen.
My research interest lie in both wearable and video Human Activity Recognition as well as the combination of both.

Before joining the groups in Siegen, I received my bachelor's degree (with distinction) in Information Systems from the University of Cologne. In 2017 I was awarded the DAAD RISE worldwide scholarship to spent three months at the Yale University under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Jakub Szefer](https://seas.yale.edu/faculty-research/faculty-directory/jakub-szefer) and [Prof. Dr. Ali Sunyaev](https://www.aifb.kit.edu/web/Ali_Sunyaev/en). In 2020 I received my masterâ€™s degree (with honors) in Data Science from the University of Mannheim.
