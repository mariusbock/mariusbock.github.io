Hi, my name is Marius and am currently doing an interdisciplinary PhD at the University of Siegen being part of two research groups (Computer Vision and Ubiquitous Computing). My research mainly focuses on combining both (wearable) sensor and video data in the context of Human Activity Recognition (HAR).


I joined both the Computer Vision group headed by [Prof. Dr. Michael Moeller](https://www.vsa.informatik.uni-siegen.de/en/moeller-michael) and the Ubiquitous Computing group headed by [Prof. Dr. Kristof Van Laerhoven](https://ubicomp.eti.uni-siegen.de/home/team/kristof.html?lang=de) at the University of Siegen in February 2021. I received my Bachelor's degree in Information Systems from the University of Cologne in 2017 and my Master's degree in Data Science from the University of Mannheim in 2020. I wrote my master thesis on "Multiple Object Tracking by Link Prediction using Graph Convolutional Networks" under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Margret Keuper](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/dws/people/professors/prof-dr-ing-margret-keuper/).


In 2015 I was awarded the Dean's list - Award for excellent students, being among the top 5% of my bachelor studies. Later that year, as part of my bachelor studies, I did an exchange semester at the University of Seoul in South Korea.


In 2016 I did a 6-month internship as a business analyst/ developer at the SAP Innovation Center Silicon Valley in Brisbane Australia. During my internship I voluntarily in Kaggle competitions and was invited to present my findings in front of the SAP Innovation Center Silicon Valley staff. 


In 2017 I received the DAAD RISE worldwide scholarship to spend 3 months as a research intern at the Yale University in the US under the co-supervision of [Prof. Dr. Jakub Szefer](https://seas.yale.edu/faculty-research/faculty-directory/jakub-szefer) and [Prof. Dr. Ali Sunyaev](https://www.aifb.kit.edu/web/Ali_Sunyaev/en).


In 2019, being part of team of 8 other Data Science students, my team and I finished top 10 of 150 teams from 28 countries in the Data Mining Cup 2019 and were invited to present our findings in Berlin.


In 2021 I was awarded the House of Young Talents - Young Acadamy 2021 PhD scholarship and ZESS Stipend Award 2021.
