Supervision of a team of students applying Deep Learning on Human Activity Recognition. The students were given a large, unlabeled Human Activity Recogntion dataset and were tasked to undergo the process of labeling and preprocessing raw sensor data until it can be used for training a prediction algorithm. Students were then assigned to reach best performing results laying focus on certain classes which were short in execution.
